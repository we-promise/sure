# ===========================================================================
# Example Docker Compose file with Pipelock agent security proxy
# ===========================================================================
#
# Purpose:
# --------
#
# This file adds Pipelock (https://github.com/luckyPipewrench/pipelock)
# as a forward proxy for Sure's outbound traffic. It provides audit
# logging and cooperative scanning for HTTP clients that respect the
# HTTPS_PROXY environment variable.
#
# Coverage:
# ---------
#
# Covered (Faraday-based clients respect HTTPS_PROXY automatically):
#   - OpenAI API calls (ruby-openai gem)
#   - Market data providers using Faraday
#
# NOT covered (these clients ignore HTTPS_PROXY):
#   - SimpleFin (HTTParty / Net::HTTP)
#   - Coinbase (HTTParty / Net::HTTP)
#   - Any code using Net::HTTP or HTTParty directly
#
# For covered traffic, Pipelock provides:
#   - Domain allowlisting (only known-good external APIs can be reached)
#   - SSRF protection (blocks connections to private/internal IPs)
#   - DLP scanning on connection targets (detects exfiltration patterns)
#   - Rate limiting per domain
#   - Structured JSON audit logging of all outbound connections
#
# Limitations:
# ------------
#
# HTTPS_PROXY is cooperative. Docker Compose has no egress network policy,
# so any code path that doesn't check the env var can connect directly.
# For hard enforcement, deploy with network-level controls that deny all
# egress except through the proxy. Example for Kubernetes:
#
#   # NetworkPolicy: deny all egress, allow only proxy + DNS
#   egress:
#     - to:
#         - podSelector:
#             matchLabels:
#               app: pipelock
#       ports:
#         - port: 8888
#     - ports:
#         - port: 53
#           protocol: UDP
#
# This compose file does NOT inspect encrypted request/response bodies
# (HTTPS is end-to-end). For deep content scanning of AI traffic, use
# Pipelock's MCP proxy mode.
#
# Monitoring:
# -----------
#
# Pipelock logs every outbound connection as structured JSON to stdout.
# View logs with: docker compose logs pipelock
#
# To expose monitoring endpoints from the host, uncomment the ports
# section on the pipelock service, then visit:
#   http://localhost:8888/health   - liveness check
#   http://localhost:8888/metrics  - Prometheus metrics
#   http://localhost:8888/stats    - JSON summary
#
# More info: https://github.com/luckyPipewrench/pipelock
#
# Setup:
# ------
#
# 1. Copy this file to compose.yml (or use -f flag)
# 2. Set your environment variables (OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN, etc.)
# 3. docker compose up
#
# Pipelock runs on port 8888 inside the Docker network. The web and worker
# services route outbound HTTPS through it via the HTTPS_PROXY env var.
#
# Customization:
# --------------
#
# Edit the pipelock command to change the preset:
#   --preset strict     Block unknown domains (recommended for production)
#   --preset balanced   Warn on unknown domains, block known-bad (default)
#   --preset audit      Log everything, block nothing (for evaluation)
#
# For a custom config, mount a file and use --config instead of --preset:
#   volumes:
#     - ./config/pipelock.yml:/etc/pipelock/config.yml:ro
#   command: ["run", "--config", "/etc/pipelock/config.yml"]
