# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Code: `app/` (Rails MVC, services, jobs, mailers, components), JS in `app/javascript/`, styles/assets in `app/assets/` (Tailwind, images, fonts).
- Config: `config/`, environment examples in `.env.local.example` and `.env.test.example`.
- Data: `db/` (migrations, seeds), fixtures in `test/fixtures/`.
- Tests: `test/` mirroring `app/` (e.g., `test/models/*_test.rb`).
- Tooling: `bin/` (project scripts), `docs/` (guides), `public/` (static), `lib/` (shared libs).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Setup: `cp .env.local.example .env.local && bin/setup` — install deps, set DB, prepare app.
- Run app: `bin/dev` — starts Rails server and asset/watchers via `Procfile.dev`.
- Test suite: `bin/rails test` — run all Minitest tests; add `TEST=test/models/user_test.rb` to target a file.
- Lint Ruby: `bin/rubocop` — style checks; add `-A` to auto-correct safe cops.
- Lint/format JS/CSS: `npm run lint` and `npm run format` — uses Biome.
- Security scan: `bin/brakeman` — static analysis for common Rails issues.

## Mobile Prototype Workflow
- Planning artifacts for the Hotwire Native prototype live in `docs/hotwire_native_prototype_plan.md`. Review and update the checklist before starting native-wrapper work.
- Implementation spikes for the native wrappers must originate from the `feature/hotwire-native-prototype` branch cut off the latest `main` once planning is approved.
- Keep PWA regressions in mind: always confirm changes behave in both the web PWA and Turbo Native contexts.
- Turbo Native requests are detected via `TurboNative::Controller`; when you add new controllers ensure they inherit from `ApplicationController` (or include the concern) so the `:turbo_native` layout variant is applied automatically.
- The native layout exports navigation metadata through `ApplicationHelper#turbo_native_navigation_payload` and the `turbo_native_bridge` Stimulus controller. When adding tabs or nav links, update the helper to keep web and native shells in sync.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Ruby: 2-space indent, `snake_case` for methods/vars, `CamelCase` for classes/modules. Follow Rails conventions for folders and file names.
- Views: ERB checked by `erb-lint` (see `.erb_lint.yml`). Avoid heavy logic in views; prefer helpers/components.
- JavaScript: `lowerCamelCase` for vars/functions, `PascalCase` for classes/components. Let Biome format code.
- Commit small, cohesive changes; keep diffs focused.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: Minitest (Rails). Name files `*_test.rb` and mirror `app/` structure.
- Run: `bin/rails test` locally and ensure green before pushing.
- Fixtures/VCR: Use `test/fixtures` and existing VCR cassettes for HTTP. Prefer unit tests plus focused integration tests.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: Imperative subject ≤ 72 chars (e.g., "Add account balance validation"). Include rationale in body and reference issues (`#123`).
- PRs: Clear description, linked issues, screenshots for UI changes, and migration notes if applicable. Ensure CI passes, tests added/updated, and `rubocop`/Biome are clean.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit secrets. Start from `.env.local.example`; use `.env.local` for development only.
- Run `bin/brakeman` before major PRs. Prefer environment variables over hard-coded values.

## Providers: Pending Transactions and FX Metadata (SimpleFIN/Plaid)

- Pending detection
  - SimpleFIN: pending when provider sends `pending: true`, or when `posted` is blank/0 and `transacted_at` is present.
  - Plaid: pending when Plaid sends `pending: true` (stored at `transaction.extra["plaid"]["pending"]` for bank/credit transactions imported via `PlaidEntry::Processor`).
- Storage (extras)
  - Provider metadata lives on `Transaction#extra`, namespaced (e.g., `extra["simplefin"]["pending"]`).
  - SimpleFIN FX: `extra["simplefin"]["fx_from"]`, `extra["simplefin"]["fx_date"]`.
- UI
  - Shows a small “Pending” badge when `transaction.pending?` is true.
- Variability
  - Some providers don’t expose pendings; in that case nothing is shown.
- Configuration (default-off)
  - SimpleFIN runtime toggles live in `config/initializers/simplefin.rb` via `Rails.configuration.x.simplefin.*`.
  - ENV-backed keys:
    - `SIMPLEFIN_INCLUDE_PENDING=1` (forces `pending=1` on SimpleFIN fetches when caller didn’t specify a `pending:` arg)
    - `SIMPLEFIN_DEBUG_RAW=1` (logs raw payload returned by SimpleFIN)

### Provider support notes

- SimpleFIN: supports pending + FX metadata; stored under `extra["simplefin"]`.
- Plaid: supports pending when the upstream Plaid payload includes `pending: true`; stored under `extra["plaid"]`.
- Plaid investments: investment transactions currently do not store pending metadata.
- Lunchflow: does not currently store pending metadata.
- Manual/CSV imports: no pending concept.
