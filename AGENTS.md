# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Code: `app/` (Rails MVC, services, jobs, mailers, components), JS in `app/javascript/`, styles/assets in `app/assets/` (Tailwind, images, fonts).
- Config: `config/`, environment examples in `.env.local.example` and `.env.test.example`.
- Data: `db/` (migrations, seeds), fixtures in `test/fixtures/`.
- Tests: `test/` mirroring `app/` (e.g., `test/models/*_test.rb`).
- Tooling: `bin/` (project scripts), `docs/` (guides), `public/` (static), `lib/` (shared libs).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Setup: `cp .env.local.example .env.local && bin/setup` — install deps, set DB, prepare app.
- Run app: `bin/dev` — starts Rails server and asset/watchers via `Procfile.dev`.
- Test suite: `bin/rails test` — run all Minitest tests; add `TEST=test/models/user_test.rb` to target a file.
- Lint Ruby: `bin/rubocop` — style checks; add `-A` to auto-correct safe cops.
- Lint/format JS/CSS: `npm run lint` and `npm run format` — uses Biome.
- Security scan: `bin/brakeman` — static analysis for common Rails issues.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Ruby: 2-space indent, `snake_case` for methods/vars, `CamelCase` for classes/modules. Follow Rails conventions for folders and file names.
- Views: ERB checked by `erb-lint` (see `.erb_lint.yml`). Avoid heavy logic in views; prefer helpers/components.
- JavaScript: `lowerCamelCase` for vars/functions, `PascalCase` for classes/components. Let Biome format code.
- Commit small, cohesive changes; keep diffs focused.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: Minitest (Rails). Name files `*_test.rb` and mirror `app/` structure.
- Run: `bin/rails test` locally and ensure green before pushing.
- Fixtures/VCR: Use `test/fixtures` and existing VCR cassettes for HTTP. Prefer unit tests plus focused integration tests.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: Imperative subject ≤ 72 chars (e.g., "Add account balance validation"). Include rationale in body and reference issues (`#123`).
- PRs: Clear description, linked issues, screenshots for UI changes, and migration notes if applicable. Ensure CI passes, tests added/updated, and `rubocop`/Biome are clean.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit secrets. Start from `.env.local.example`; use `.env.local` for development only.
- Run `bin/brakeman` before major PRs. Prefer environment variables over hard-coded values.

## Internationalization & Localization

### Adding Community Translations
We welcome community-contributed localizations! Follow these steps:

1. **Create locale directory**: `config/locales/[language_code]/` (e.g., `config/locales/fr/`)
2. **Mirror English structure**: Copy file structure from `config/locales/en/`
3. **Translate consistently**: Maintain terminology and preserve interpolation variables
4. **Update SUPPORTED_LOCALES**: Add language code to `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` array in `app/helpers/languages_helper.rb`
5. **Update LANGUAGE_MAPPING**: Ensure language appears in `LANGUAGE_MAPPING` hash in same file
6. **Test thoroughly**: Switch language in settings and verify all major features

### Translation Guidelines
- Always use `t()` helper for user-facing strings
- Organize keys hierarchically: `feature.component.key`
- Preserve variables exactly: `%{name}`, `%{count}`, etc.
- Respect pluralization rules for target language
- Keep HTML tags and formatting intact
- Test in context, not isolation

### Quality Standards
- Complete core features before peripheral ones
- Document incomplete sections in PR
- Verify number/date/currency formatting for locale
- Check for missing keys in development mode
